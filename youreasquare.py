#You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!
#However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.
#Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:  In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
#The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.
#RM:  I cheated converting integer to string
